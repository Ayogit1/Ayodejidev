  <h1>Robots, And Us!</h1>
<p>Robots today are transforming everything from our homes to hospitals, farms to factories. Here are a few short stories that bring their modern roles to life. Believe it or not, they are here to stay!</p>

<p>Robots have been found to be useful in the follwing areas: </p>

</ul>

<h2>In the hospital </h2> 
<p>At St. Anne’s Hospital in London, a robot named “Florence” glides silently through the corridors after midnight. She’s not a nurse in the traditional sense but she delivers medications, monitors patient vitals, and even alerts staff if someone’s oxygen levels drop. </p>

<h2>At home </h2>
<p>In a bustling London flat, a robotic vacuum named “Dusty” hums to life every morning at 7:00 AM. While its owner sips coffee and checks emails, Dusty maps the apartment, dodges furniture, and sweeps up yesterday’s crumbs. </p>

<h2>On the farm </h2>
<p>On a farm in Cambridgeshire, a robot tractor plows fields with GPS precision. It doesn’t need lunch breaks or sleep. It plants seeds, sprays crops, and even detects weeds using AI-powered cameras.</p>

<h2>In the factory </h2>
<p>In a Midlands manufacturing plant, robotic arms work in perfect synchrony—welding, assembling, and inspecting car parts with microscopic precision. These robots don’t just follow instructions; they learn from mistakes, adapt to new tasks, and alert engineers before a fault becomes a failure.</p>
